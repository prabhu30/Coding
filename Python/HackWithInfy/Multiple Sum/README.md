# Multiple Sum

# Question :
Given a positive number x, find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than or equals to x. For example, if x = 12 then the multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than or equals to 12 are 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12. The sum of these multiples is 45.

# Input Format :
  First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, x.

# Output Format :
  For each test case, print an integer in a new line that denotes the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 <= x. 

# Constraints :
  1 <= T <= 10^5 <br>
  1 <= x <= 10^9
  
# Sample Input :
  2 <br>
  12 <br>
  15

# Sample Output :
  45 <br>
  60

# Explanation :
  For x = 12, the multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than or equals to 12 are 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12. The sum of these multiples is 45. <br>
  For x = 15, the multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than or equals to 15 are 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15. The sum of these multiples is 60.
