# Question :
Write a program to print the following pattern

<pre>
        *
      * + *
    * + + + *
  * + + + + + *
* * * * * * * * *
</pre>

Note: This program should be written with a general logic, and not using just a bunch of "Print" statements. The user should enter the height and based on that, the triangle should populate.
