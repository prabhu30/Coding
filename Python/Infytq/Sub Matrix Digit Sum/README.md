# Sub Matrix digits Sum

# Question :
You will be given two integers representing row count and column count of a matrix and a matrix of that size.

From that Matrix we have to find the possible 2*2 matrix where each of those matrices should follow the given rule :

Each element of matrix should be divisible by sum of its digits.


# Input Format :
First Line: Row count Column Count

Matrix of size [Row count x Column Count]

# Output Format :
Print all the sub matrices that follow the given rule one after the other.

# Sample Test Case

# Input :
<pre>
4 3
40 42 2
30 24 27
180 190 40
11 121 13
</pre>

# Output :
<pre>
40 42
30 24
42 2
24 27
30 24
180 190
24 27
190 40
</pre>

**Note: There are four matrices of sizes 2*2 in the above output.**

Print all the matrices of a particular row, and then move on to the next row.
