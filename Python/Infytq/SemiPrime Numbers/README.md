# InfyTQ - SemiPrime Numbers

# Question :
A semiprime number is a natural number that is the product of two (not necessarily distinct) primes.

For example:

# Input: 
57

# Output: 
true

57 is a semiprime number because it is the product of two primes, 57 = 3 * 19

# Input: 
121

# Output: 
true

(121 is a semiprime number because it is the product of two primes, 121 = 11 * 11)

# Input:
186

# Output:
false

(186 is not a semiprime number because it is the product of three primes: 186 = 2 * 3 * 31)

Write a program to generate all the semiprimes upto a given number(inclusive).

# Input Format :

The first line contains an integer, t denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer, n which represents the upper bound to generate semi primes.

# Constraints :
1<=t<=10

0<=n<=105

# Output Format :
For every test case print all the semi primes upto n (inclusive) seperated by a space.

# Sample Input 0

2
10
8

# Sample Output 0
<pre>
4 6 9 10
4 6
</pre>
