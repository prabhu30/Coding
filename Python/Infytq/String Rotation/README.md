# String rotation based on squares

# Question :
You are given a list of strings each having 2 components to it - word and integer. These 2 components are separated by ":". <br>
If the square of digits in the number component is even, then you must rotate the word to the right by 1 <br>
If the square of digits in the number component is odd, then you must rotate the word to the left by 2 <br>
Finally, print the rotated word.

# Example Input
rhdt:246,ghftd:1246

# Output
trhd
ftdgh

# Explanation

2*2+4*4+6*6 = 56 which is even so rotate rhdt --> trhd

1*1+2*2+4*4+6*6 = 57 which is odd so rotate ghftd --> ftdgh
