# Summations Calculator

# Question :
Write a program that takes 4 inputs, a lower bound,a upper bound, an operator and an operand. Calculate the sum of that range based on the given operator and operator and 
output the result as shown in sample test cases.

Note: the operators will be any one of the following +,-,*,/ where /is integer division.

# Sample Test Case 1

# Input :
2 4 * 2

# Output :
18

# Explanation :
(2*2 + 3*2 + 4*2)

# Sample Test Case 2

# Input :
1 5 % 2

# Output :
3

# Explanation :
(1%2 + 2%2 + 3%2 + 4%2 + 5%2)

# Input Format
Single line consists of four space separated inputs representing lower bound,upper bound,operator,operand respectively.

# Output Format
