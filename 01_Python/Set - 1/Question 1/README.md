  is denoted by c_i. Rahul and Tina want to know in how many boxes can they keep their toys such that both the toys are in the same box.

# Input Format :
  The first line of the input contains integer N, denoting the count of boxes. Each of the next N lines contains two integers t_i and c_i denoting the number of toys present in
  the i_th box and the maximum capacity of that box.
  
# Output Format :
  Print the maximum number of boxes that fulfill the conditions.
  
# Constraints :
  1 <= N <= 100 <br>
  0 <= t_i, c_i <= 100

# Time Limit :
  1 second

# Example :
